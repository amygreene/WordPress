== upgrade from 3.6.1 to 3.8.0 ==
12-31-2013
* no issues found with core upgrade

=== plugin notes ===
* did not upgrade to latest NextGen Gallery due to forum posts about significant increases in resources, will revisit
* did not upgrade Haiku Audio, current version still does not work 100%, sticking with vs. 0.4.6
* Google Analytics - tried to upgrade to 2.1.1 but not functional (white screen on plugin settings) downgraded to 1.2.1
* Remove Email Verification - has been rewritten, updated customizations in classes/public.removeverification.php to replace references to auto-generated password with "Use your Evergreen domain password"
* upgraded wpmu-plugin-stats from 1.4 to 2.0
* The latest upgrade to multisite-privacy vs 1.1.8.3 conflicts with BBPress plugin 2.5.2. Non super-admin users lose access to all bbpress administration within their own sites with error "You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page."
If reverted back to 1.1.8.1 of the multisite privacy plugin error goes away is working with BBPress.
This conflict also happens with site-categories plugin vs 1.0.8.7, problem dissappears if reverted back to site-categories 1.0.8.3
php error log gives this error only when newer version of wpmudev plugins are activated:
bbp_setup_current_user was called <strong>incorrectly</strong>. The current user is being initialized without using $wp->init().
